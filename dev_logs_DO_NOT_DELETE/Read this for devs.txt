--> Agora Frontend Issues [codefiles_here.js] :
 > Rejoin after Token Expiration : Token Generation and Adding of Token once Token Expires (For testing token exipiry is set to 300 seconds)
 > Token Generation with UID (integer) not with UUID Module (string). Agora has some problems with string usernames.


--> Backend Issues [codefiles_here.py] : 
 > Cleanup Database API : There is an api to clean the database, to empty the meeting link which are not used further. Update : need to change the schema of the Meeting database from recording 'created_date', to 'last_joined' date, and then delete based, on the 'owner_last_joined_date'. If not joined, then delete based on 'created_date'
 > Error Handling with proper Error Codes are not made for Backend API. [DB Interaction Fail-Proofs [Names / ID Missmatch] , Unprocessable Entities in APIs (API Input)]


--> Extras : 
 > Remote Users List : Not working fine : (It messes up the owner / exsisting particiants those who joined earlier.)
 > Agora don't exit channel and leave the Microphone, when a user suddenly closes the window / device.
 > Mute / Unmute Working Flawless in npm run build, not in npm start - maybe dude to multiple instance creation... in npm start : takes 2 taps to works for the first time, then it's falwless.
